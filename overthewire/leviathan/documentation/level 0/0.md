when ls -a the file:

i saw that only one file had the non root creator

when grepping the word "password" in the file i got this:

<DT><A HREF="http://leviathan.labs.overthewire.org/passwordus.html | This will be fixed later, the password for leviathan1 is 3QJ3TgzHDq" ADD_DATE="1155384634" LAST_CHARSET="ISO-8859-1" ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>

so 3QJ3TgzHDq is probably the password
