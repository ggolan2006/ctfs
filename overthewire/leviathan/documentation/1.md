after seeing same shit but with an exe CHECK file

when entering the password of the last level it didnt work

in the last level this was going on: ID="rdf:#$2wIU71">password to leviathan1</A>

this didnt work but when xxd into binary file i saw that:

........password
00002010: 3a20 002f 6269 6e2f 7368 0057 726f 6e67  : ./bin/sh.Wrong
00002020: 2070 6173 7377 6f72 642c 2047 6f6f 6420   password, Good
00002030: 4279 6520 2e2e 2e00 011b 033b 2800 0000  Bye .......;(..

so now i will check the address mantioned:

after objdumping the code i will now look for any mantiones for passwrds:

didnt find any

when entering the word sex to ./check i go to where i went when /bin/sh into the mashine

didnt work...

found out that when entering password as "sex" it linkes me to bin/sh - so dash

when inside the dash i have premission to read the files as leviathan2 and i accessed the file in level 2 and read the password: NsN1HwFoyN
